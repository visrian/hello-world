# hello-world
A place for me to project ideas and thoughts.
I am a computer science undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania. I will be a sophomore at Penn in Fall 2015. Having taken my first ever computer science course during Spring 2015, I am relatively new to programming and Computer Science. I am interested to learn more while I am familiar with the basics of Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am looking forward to working on my own ideas and contributing in whatever way possible towards the ideas of my peers.
